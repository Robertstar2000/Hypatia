## About The Project

Project Hypatia is your digital lab partner, an AI-powered platform designed to assist researchers, students, and citizen scientists throughout the entire scientific discovery process. It provides a structured, 10-step workflow, leveraging the Google Gemini API to streamline every stage of research, from question formulation to a publication-ready draft. It acts as a comprehensive digital lab notebook, guiding users from an initial spark of an idea to a fully-formed publication draft, all within a single, cohesive interface. The goal is to democratize the research process, offering a structured yet flexible environment for scientific exploration.

## The HMAP Philosophy (Human-Mediated Agentic Process)

Project Hypatia is built on the principle of the **Human-Mediated Agentic Process (HMAP)**. This is a framework for human-AI collaboration that emphasizes human agency and control throughout the research lifecycle.

-   **Human as the Director**: You are the principal investigator. The AI is your highly capable, but subordinate, research assistant. It suggests, drafts, and analyzes, but you make the final decisions.
-   **AI as the Agent**: The AI agent (Gemini) executes complex tasks based on your instructions. This includes literature searches, hypothesis generation, data synthesis, and drafting content. In advanced steps, multiple agents collaborate to achieve a goal.
-   **Mediation as the Interface**: The Hypatia application is the "mediation" layer. It structures the interaction, provides tools for control (like fine-tuning and editing), and ensures the workflow remains logical and scientifically rigorous.

HMAP is not about letting an AI run the entire research process. It's about augmenting human intellect and creativity by offloading the tedious and time-consuming aspects of research to an AI partner, freeing you up to focus on critical thinking, interpretation, and discovery.

## The Scientific Method & Hypatia

The traditional scientific method is a systematic process for inquiry. Project Hypatia's 10-step workflow is designed to mirror and enhance this process.

| Scientific Method Stage | Corresponding Hypatia Step(s)                                   | How Hypatia Enhances It                                                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observation/Idea**      | `Dashboard` (Create Research Project)                           | Provides a structured way to capture and describe your initial idea.                                                  |

## Usage Guide

### 1. Choosing Your Workflow: Manual vs. Automated

After completing Step 1 (Research Question), you will be prompted to choose a workflow mode. This is a critical decision that shapes how you interact with the AI for the rest of the project.

-   **Manual Control**: This is the standard, recommended mode for detailed research. You will proceed step-by-step, generating, reviewing, editing, and approving the AI's output at each stage. This mode gives you maximum control and is ideal when you are providing your own data or need to guide the AI's logic carefully.

-   **Automated Generation**: In this mode, the AI takes over and completes all remaining steps (2 through 10) in one continuous process. It will synthesize its own data in Step 6 and build the entire research project based on its best judgment. This mode is excellent for educational purposes, rapid ideation, or exploring what a full research arc on a topic might look like. *Please be patient, as this process can take several minutes.*

### 2. The 10-Step Workflow

When you open the app, you start on the landing page and can navigate to the **Dashboard**. From there, you can create a new research project or select an existing one. This will take you to the main workspace. If you choose "Manual Control," you will progress through the steps one by one. The AI's output at each step informs the next, creating a cohesive research narrative.

**Full Control**: You have full control over the AI's output.
-   On any step where text has been generated, you will see an **<i class="bi bi-pencil-square"></i> Edit** button.
-   Clicking it turns the text into an editable field. Make your changes and click the **<i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Save** button.
-   Your saved version becomes the new "official" output for that step and will be used to provide context for all future AI generations.

### 3. Fine-Tuning the AI

In each step of the workspace, you can click the **<i class="bi bi-sliders"></i> Fine-Tune AI** button. This opens a modal with parameters specific to that step, allowing you to guide the AI's behavior more precisely. For example, you can change the persona of the peer reviewer in Step 9, demand a more detailed methodology in Step 4, or ask for more novel hypotheses in Step 3.

### 4. The Experiment Runner (Step 6)

This step is a powerful, multi-modal hub for generating your experimental data. You will be prompted to choose one of five methods:

**A) Upload Your Data**
-   The most straightforward option. If you have already conducted your experiment and have a dataset, you can directly upload it in CSV format.

**B) External Simulation (Google Colab)**
-   For complex experiments, you can use external tools like Google Colab. Once your simulation is complete, export your data as a CSV and use the **Upload Your Data** option to bring it into Project Hypatia.

**C) Agentic AI Simulation**
1.  **AI Writes the Code**: The AI will read your methodology from Step 4 and automatically write a JavaScript simulation.
2.  **Agentic Debugging**: When you click "Start Agentic Simulation," an AI Debugger agent takes over. It runs the code in a secure sandbox.
3.  **Autonomous Correction**: If the code fails, the Debugger agent analyzes the error, rewrites the code to fix it, and retries. This loop continues until the code runs successfully and produces data, or until it reaches a maximum number of attempts.
4.  **Completion**: The final, working code and its data output are saved to the step.

**D) Dynamic Manual Data Entry**
-   The AI will read your Data Collection Plan from Step 5 and generate a structured data entry table for you to fill in.

**E) AI Data Synthesis**
-   Ideal for theoretical exploration. The AI will read your methodology and generate a plausible, synthetic dataset that logically follows from your research design.
