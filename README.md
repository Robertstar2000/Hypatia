## Usage Guide

### 1. The 10-Step Workflow

When you open the app, you start on the landing page and can navigate to the **Dashboard**. From there, you can create a new experiment or select an existing one. This will take you to the main workspace, which guides you through the scientific method. The AI's output at each step informs the next, creating a cohesive research narrative.

| Step | Title                   | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--- | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Research Question       | Refine a broad idea into a focused, testable scientific question.                                                                                                       |
| 2    | Literature Review       | Uses Google Search grounding to survey recent, relevant academic papers, identifying key findings and research gaps.                                                      |
| 3    | Hypothesis Formulation  | Generate multiple, distinct, and testable hypotheses based on the literature review.                                                                                    |
| 4    | Methodology Design      | Design a detailed, step-by-step experimental protocol appropriate for the chosen field of study.                                                                        |
| 5    | Data Collection Plan    | Outline the specific variables to be measured, the format for data recording, and quality control procedures.                                                             |
| 6    | **Experiment Runner**   | The core experimental step. Choose to run a custom JavaScript simulation, upload your own dataset, or have the AI synthesize a plausible one.                               |
| 7    | Data Analyzer           | Ingests data from Step 6 and performs statistical analysis, generating a narrative summary and a live data visualization (using Chart.js) via a structured JSON output.     |
| 8    | Conclusion Drawing      | Interpret the analysis results to determine if the hypothesis was supported, discussing implications, limitations, and future work.                                       |
| 9    | Peer Review Simulation  | Submits the entire project to a simulated AI peer reviewer (with adjustable personas like 'Harsh Critic') for constructive feedback.                                        |
| 10   | Publication Exporter    | Assembles the entire research journey into a formatted, publication-ready draft paper, including Abstract, Introduction, Methods, etc.                                      |

**Full Control**: You have full control over the AI's output.
-   On any step where text has been generated, you will see an **<i class="bi bi-pencil-square"></i> Edit** button.
-   Clicking it turns the text into an editable field. Make your changes and click the **<i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Save** button.
-   Your saved version becomes the new "official" output for that step and will be used to provide context for all future AI generations.

### 2. Fine-Tuning the AI

In each step of the workspace, you can click the **<i class="bi bi-sliders"></i> Fine-Tune AI** button. This opens a modal with parameters specific to that step, allowing you to guide the AI's behavior more precisely. For example, you can change the persona of the peer reviewer in Step 9, demand a more detailed methodology in Step 4, or ask for more novel hypotheses in Step 3.

### 3. The Experiment Runner (Step 6)

This step offers three powerful paths forward, accessible via tabs:

**A) Run Custom Code:**
1.  **Write Code**: In the "Run Custom Code" tab, you'll find a text editor where you can write your simulation in JavaScript.
2.  **Debug**: Use `console.log()` to print messages to the output panel below the editor.
3.  **Finish the Experiment**: When your code has generated the results, call the special `hypatia.finish()` function to pass the data to the next step.

```javascript
// This special function connects your code to the app's workflow.
// It takes two string arguments: data and a summary.

hypatia.finish(data, summary);

// EXAMPLE:
const csvData = "time,temperature\n0,20\n1,22\n2,25";
const summaryText = "Simulated temperature increase over 2 seconds.";

hypatia.finish(csvData, summaryText);
```

**B) Upload Own Data:**
-   If you've conducted your experiment offline, use this tab to upload the results.
-   You can first click **Download Template** to have the AI generate a CSV header based on your Data Collection Plan from Step 5, ensuring correct formatting.
-   Then, choose your file and click **Use This Data for Analysis** to send it to Step 7.

**C) Skip & Synthesize Results:**
-   If you don't want to write code or upload data, simply click the **Skip & Synthesize Results** button (available in the "Run Custom Code" tab).
-   The AI will read your methodology and data plans from the previous steps.
-   It will then generate a plausible, synthetic dataset that logically follows from your research design.
-   This synthetic data is then automatically passed to Step 7 for analysis.
