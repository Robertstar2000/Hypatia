## The HMAP Philosophy (Human-Mediated Agentic Process)

Project Hypatia is built on the principle of the **Human-Mediated Agentic Process (HMAP)**. This is a framework for human-AI collaboration that emphasizes human agency and control throughout the research lifecycle.

-   **Human as the Director**: You are the principal investigator. The AI is your highly capable, but subordinate, research assistant. It suggests, drafts, and analyzes, but you make the final decisions.
-   **AI as the Agent**: The AI agent (Gemini) executes complex tasks based on your instructions. This includes literature searches, hypothesis generation, data synthesis, and drafting content.
-   **Mediation as the Interface**: The Hypatia application is the "mediation" layer. It structures the interaction, provides tools for control (like fine-tuning and editing), and ensures the workflow remains logical and scientifically rigorous.

HMAP is not about letting an AI run the entire research process. It's about augmenting human intellect and creativity by offloading the tedious and time-consuming aspects of research to an AI partner, freeing you up to focus on critical thinking, interpretation, and discovery.

## The Scientific Method & Hypatia

The traditional scientific method is a systematic process for inquiry. Project Hypatia's 10-step workflow is designed to mirror and enhance this process.

## Usage Guide

### 1. The 10-Step Workflow

When you open the app, you start on the landing page and can navigate to the **Dashboard**. From there, you can create a new research project or select an existing one. This will take you to the main workspace, which guides you through the scientific method. The AI's output at each step informs the next, creating a cohesive research narrative.

**Full Control**: You have full control over the AI's output.
-   On any step where text has been generated, you will see an **<i class="bi bi-pencil-square"></i> Edit** button.
-   Clicking it turns the text into an editable field. Make your changes and click the **<i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Save** button.
-   Your saved version becomes the new "official" output for that step and will be used to provide context for all future AI generations.

### 2. Fine-Tuning the AI

In each step of the workspace, you can click the **<i class="bi bi-sliders"></i> Fine-Tune AI** button. This opens a modal with parameters specific to that step, allowing you to guide the AI's behavior more precisely. For example, you can change the persona of the peer reviewer in Step 9, demand a more detailed methodology in Step 4, or ask for more novel hypotheses in Step 3.

### 3. The Experiment Runner (Step 6)

This step is a powerful, multi-modal hub for generating your experimental data. You will be prompted to choose one of five methods:

**A) Upload Your Data**
-   The most straightforward option. If you have already conducted your experiment and have a dataset, you can directly upload it.
-   The application accepts data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.
-   This is also the method you'll use to import results from an external simulation run in tools like Google Colab.

**B) External Simulation (Google Colab)**
-   For complex experiments that require more computational power or specific Python libraries, you can use Google Colab.
-   The app provides a direct link to open Colab and instructions for connecting it to a web application using Anvil, a framework that turns notebooks into web services.
-   **Setup Template:**
    1.  In your Anvil web app, enable the "Server Uplink" service to get an Uplink key.
    2.  In your Colab notebook, install the `anvil-uplink` library: `!pip install anvil-uplink`.
    3.  Connect your notebook to Anvil: `import anvil.server; anvil.server.connect("YOUR_UPLINK_KEY")`.
    4.  You can then call functions defined in your Colab notebook from your Anvil web app.
-   Once your simulation is complete, export your data as a CSV and use the **Upload Your Data** option to bring it into Project Hypatia for analysis.

**C) AI-Generated Simulation**
1.  **AI Writes the Code**: The AI will read your methodology from Step 4 and automatically write a JavaScript simulation as a starting point.
2.  **Run & Debug**: You can edit the code, use `console.log()` to print debug messages, and run the simulation directly in the browser's secure sandbox.
3.  **Finish the Experiment**: The simulation must call the special `hypatia.finish(csvData, summary)` function to pass its results (in CSV string format) to the next step for analysis.
4.  **Auto-Fix with AI**: If your code has a runtime error, an **Auto-Fix with AI** button will appear, allowing the AI to attempt to correct the bug for you.

```javascript
// Example of the required finish function:
const csvData = "time,temperature\n0,20\n1,22\n2,25";
const summaryText = "Simulated temperature increase over 2 seconds.";

// This call passes the data to Step 7.
hypatia.finish(csvData, summaryText);
```

**D) Dynamic Manual Data Entry**
-   If you've conducted your experiment offline, select this mode.
-   The AI will read your Data Collection Plan from Step 5 and generate a structured data entry table with the correct columns.
-   You can add or remove rows and enter your data directly into the form.
-   Once finished, click "Submit Data" to convert your entries into a CSV format and send it to Step 7 for analysis.

**E) AI Data Synthesis**
-   This mode is ideal for theoretical exploration or when you want to proceed without running a full simulation.
-   The AI will read your methodology and data plans from the previous steps.
-   It will then generate a plausible, synthetic dataset that logically follows from your research design.
-   You can review the generated data and summary, then click "Use This Data" to pass it to Step 7.
